# Comparing `python` plotting libraries to `ggplot2`

Based on the elegant [Grammar of Graphics][wilkinson], the `ggplot2` package is
primary choice for producing statistical graphics in R. However, those of us who
have to program in Python would also like to produce statistics charts of a
similar quality. This repo is an experiment: how much Python code does it take
to create a (80% or above) reproduction of a relatively simple `ggplot2` chart?

We try out six different Python packages: `matplotlib`, `plotly`, `altair`,
`seaborn`, `plotext` for fun, and `plotnine`.
